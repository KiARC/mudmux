Remaining script reorganization
 - utils belongs in scripts, outside medievia?

Longer term tasks:

 - upgrade tintin?

 - detect when tmux session already exists and reattach

 - general configuration stuff
    - characters
    - credentials
    - text editor
    - rcfiles
    - iterm configurable (as above)
    - consider running a script first (mudmux executable or in tmux.yaml?) to bring in environment variables with profile names etc.

 - eliminate dependency on iTerm (make this configurable?)
    - package a portable iterm profile?
    - use a tmux conf for cases where iterm integration isn't available

 - continue to improve docker usage
    - switch back to alpine? (segfaults with #chat call)
    - use a normal user; don't like running as root

 - additional tmuxp improvements
    - maybe switch to tmuxinator??
    - can't use -CC directly with tmuxp, need to create a detached session and then attach with tmux -CC
      - consider pushing changes to upstream tmuxp to add this functionality
      - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/171
      - "no previous window" error from tmux, currently addressed by pinning the version of tmuxp==1.3.2, has workarounds and issues:
         - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/364#issuecomment-584617782
         - note adding a second window in the background may address this

Updates to README
 - Add a section on how to configure
 - Add a section on how to leverage mudmux features when scripting
