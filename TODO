Remaining script reorganization
 - utils belongs in scripts, outside medievia?

Longer term tasks:

 - upgrade tintin?

 - detect when tmux session already exists and reattach

- general configuration stuff
    - characters
    - credentials
    - text editor
    - rcfiles
    - iterm configurable (as above)

 - eliminate dependency on iTerm (make this configurable?)
    - package a portable iterm profile?
    - use a tmux conf for cases where iterm integration isn't available

 - continue to improve docker usage
    - switch back to alpine? (segfaults with #chat call)

Updates to README
 - Add a section on how to configure
 - Add a section on how to leverage mudmux features when scripting
