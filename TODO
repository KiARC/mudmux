Remaining script reorganization
 - utils belongs in scripts, outside medievia?
   - also chat and other logging capabilities should be generalized
   - everything that interacts with windows/panes
 - consider a constants module?

Longer term tasks:

 - upgrade tintin?

 - continue to improve docker usage
    - switch back to alpine? (segfaults with #chat call)
    - use a normal user; don't like running as root
    - fix bash service so the appropriate environment variables have been loaded
    - the usage of /home/fil[<8;17;9mes is weird. should audit and clean up volumes...

 - additional tmuxp improvements
    - maybe switch to tmuxinator??
    - can't use -CC directly with tmuxp, need to create a detached and then attach with tmux -CC
      - consider pushing changes to upstream tmuxp to add this functionality
      - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/171
      - "no previous window" error from tmux
         - currently addressed by pinning the version of tmuxp==1.3.2, has workarounds and issues:
           - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/364#issuecomment-584617782
         - note adding a second window in the background may address this

 - Generalize
   - add ability for multiple, named chat connections
   - gracefully handle different script dir trees i.e. for different games?

Updates to README
 - Add a section on how to leverage mudmux features when scripting

Other iTerm-related changes
 - package a portable iterm profile?
 - use a tmux conf for cases where iterm integration isn't available

Cleanup
 - deal with inner data directory
   - will need to consider where default notes lives, and be sure it's available to touch
