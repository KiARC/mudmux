Eliminate dependency on iTerm (make this configurable?)
 - package a portable iterm profile?
 - use a tmux conf for cases where iterm integration isn't available

Continue to improve docker usage
 - switch back to alpine? (segfaults with #chat call)
 - how much of the run command can be brought into docker-compose.yaml

Longer term tasks:
 - upgrade tintin?
 - detect when tmux session already exists and reattach
 - general configuration stuff
    - characters
    - credentials
    - text editor
    - rcfiles
    - iterm configurable (as above)

Updates to README
 - Add a section on how to configure
 - Add a section on how to leverage mudmux features when scripting
