Remaining script reorganization
 - utils belongs in scripts, outside medievia?
   - also chat and other logging capabilities should be generalized
   - everything that interacts with windows/panes
 - consider a constants module?

pip installable package
  - just depends on config stuff to be clean
  - README.md should reflect how to pip install straight from github
    - https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/11/pip-install-from-a-git-repository/

Longer term tasks:

 - upgrade tintin?

 - continue to improve docker usage
    - switch back to alpine? (segfaults with #chat call)
    - use a normal user; don't like running as root
    - fix bash service so the appropriate environment variables have been loaded
    - the usage of /home/files is weird. should audit and clean up volumes...

 - additional tmuxp improvements
    - maybe switch to tmuxinator??
    - can't use -CC directly with tmuxp, need to create a detached and then attach with tmux -CC
      - consider pushing changes to upstream tmuxp to add this functionality
      - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/171
      - "no previous window" error from tmux
         - currently addressed by pinning the version of tmuxp==1.3.2, has workarounds and issues:
           - https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp/issues/364#issuecomment-584617782
         - note adding a second window in the background may address this

Updates to README
 - Add a section on how to leverage mudmux features when scripting

Other iTerm-related changes
 - package a portable iterm profile?
 - use a tmux conf for cases where iterm integration isn't available

Generalize
 - add ability for multiple, named chat connections
 - gracefully handle different script dir trees i.e. for different games?
